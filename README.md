Input validation for email addresses using regular expressions.
RESTful API with clean and descriptive error handling.
Spring Boot-based backend with easy configuration.
⚙️ Technologies Used

Jakarta Validation for email format checks
Gmail SMTP Server to send emails
🛠 Prerequisites
To run this project, you'll need:

JDK 17+ installed on your machine.
A Gmail account with App Password enabled (learn how to set up an App Password here).
Maven or Gradle to build and run the project.
🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/ShivamP75/MailService.git
cd mailservice
2. Configure SMTP Settings
In the src/main/resources/application.properties file, provide your Gmail account details and an App Password for sending emails securely:

properties
Copy code
spring.application.name=mail
spring.mail.host=smtp.gmail.com
spring.mail.port=587
spring.mail.username=your_email@gmail.com     # Replace with your Gmail ID
spring.mail.password=your_app_password        # Replace with your Gmail App Password
spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.auth=true
spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.starttls.enable=true
⚠️ Important: Never share or commit your credentials! Use environment variables or a .gitignore'd config file for production.

3. Build and Run the Project
If you're using Maven, run:

bash
Copy code
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
Or, if you're using Gradle:

./gradlew bootRun
📬 Usage
Once the server is running, you can send a POST request to /send-mail endpoint.

Sample Request
Make a GET request to:

GET http://localhost:8080/send-mail
Request Body (JSON)
json
{
    "to" : "recipient@example.com",
    "subject" : "Test Email",
    "body" : "Hello, this is a test email!"
}
Sample Response (Success)
json
{
    "message": "Mail sent to recipient@example.com"
}
Sample Response (Validation Error)
json
{
    "to": "Email id is incorrect"
}
Handling Errors
If the email format is invalid or any required field is missing, the API will return a descriptive message with an HTTP 400 status.
